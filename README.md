![Todo List App Screenshot](todo-list-app-screenshot.png)

## Overview

This is a simple Todo List App developed using Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework, and integrated with LocalStorage for data persistence. The app allows users to create, manage, and organize their tasks efficiently. Tasks can be categorized as "business" or "personal," and users can mark tasks as completed or delete them as needed. The app ensures that the user's task list and progress are saved even after they close or refresh the browser.

## Features

- Add new tasks with a description and category (business or personal).
- Mark tasks as completed when they are done.
- Edit task content directly in the list.
- Delete tasks that are no longer needed.
- Tasks are sorted in ascending order based on their creation time.
- The app saves the user's name and task list in LocalStorage for data persistence.

## Technologies Used

- Vue.js: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- LocalStorage: A browser feature for storing data locally in the user's browser.
- HTML: For creating the structure of the app.
- CSS: For styling the app components.
